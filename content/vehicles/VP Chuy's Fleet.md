Chuy's a very diverse member who has all three types of vehicles.  He's one of the few members we have that has a truck, a car, and a motorcycle (The Trifecta)!  Depending on his mood and if the weather is right, he may take his bike for a cruise or if he has some added company to tag along, he may take the 4 door sedan. But most of the time you'll see him and his wife cruising in his truck.  No matter what, our VP is always down to cruise, no matter what mode.

* 1966 Chevrolet C10 Stepside (Flat Metallic Burnt orange w/ Black & yellow scallops)
* 1956 Ford Fairlane 4 door Sedan (Flat Black and Maroon 2 tone paint)
