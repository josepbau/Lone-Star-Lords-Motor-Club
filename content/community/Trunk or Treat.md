**October is always a great time of the year to bring out the rides, especially with the cooler weather.  This cooler weather definitely cuts down on the overheating issues some may encounter with our cars.  But October is also one of the busiest months with the Halloween and Car Shows, specifically Trunk or Treats.**

**Trunk or Treats are a good way to showcase our rides along with giving back to our community by providing a safe and controlled environment for the kiddos to walk around freely, trick or treat, visit all the cars and members, and fill their goodie bags.** 

**This event is also a good time to invite other clubs to join and meet up for a good cause and to network. The addition of the other clubs makes for a larger event for the kids to enjoy.**
