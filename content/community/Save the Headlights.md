## Benefit for Breast Cancer Awareness Month

For the month of October our club sells limited T-Shirt prints in support of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month to benefit a local clinic in San Antonio, TX.  Our club designs a new *"Save The Headlights'* Support Club t-shirt every year to sell in September and October to raise funds in order to donate to **S.L.E.W. Cancer Wellness Center** in San Antonio, TX.  

## S.L.E.W. Cancer Wellness Center

Our club chose to team up and donate all our proceeds from the sale of our t-shirts to the **S.L.E.W. Cancer Wellness Center**, which is a non profit agency for uninsured, and low-income women who are diagnosed with all types of cancer. We chose this organization due to their mission of _"providing free **emotional and physical support** to meet the needs of disadvantaged women by providing a continuum of care that restores the health and dignity of vulnerable women who become isolated and invisible after treatment."
