Breast Cancer Awareness month, also referred to in the U.S. as National Breast Cancer Awareness Month is held in the month of October.  Our club designs a new *"Save The Headlights'* Support Club t-shirt to sell in September and October to generate funds in order to donate to **S.L.E.W. Cancer Wellness Center** in San Antonio, TX.  The **S.L.E.W. Cancer Wellness Center**, is a non profit agency for uninsured, uninsured, and low-income with who are diagnosed with all types of cancer that our club chose to team up with and donate our proceeds to. We chose this organization due to their mission of _"providing free **emotional and physical support** to meet the needs of disadvantaged women by providing a continuum of care that restores the health and dignity of vulnerable women who become isolated and invisible after treatment." 

- **Each year the club votes on which member's vehicle will be the face for that year's campaign**
- **Front and Back design for shirt print is voted on and submitted to print shop for a run of 250, distribution date TBD.**
- **All shirts sold every weekend during the months of September and October by members at car meets, bars, and swap meets.**
- **Cost $20, sizes available S,M, L, and XL. (sizes XXL, XXXL-additional $5, must be pre-ordered and paid in advance)**
