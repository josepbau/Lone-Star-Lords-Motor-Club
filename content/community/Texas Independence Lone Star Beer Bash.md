**Every year we host our annual Lone Star Texas Independence Beer Bash to commemorate Texas Independence Day which is on March 2nd. Our annual party is usually held the weekend prior or after the actual date of the holiday. This event is near and dear to our club as well as our sponsor, Lone Star Beer. It's not everyday that a local car club has the sponsorship and support of the National Beer of Texas. This event would not be possible if it wasn't for our sponsor and the love of our Lone Star State.**
