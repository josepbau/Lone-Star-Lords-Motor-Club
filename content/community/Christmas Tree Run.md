Every year we meet at one of our local Home Depot's and pick up any old, dying, and damaged Christmas trees that are deemed unsellable or discounted from their Garden Center.  We carefully scour through the pile they have set aside for us in the Garden Center and pick all trees that are salvageable.  We bring our shears and saws in order to cut damaged areas and branches off.  We prune them so they're are presentable and aesthetically pleasant.  We then bail or tie them in the netting wrap or string to prep the trees for transport.  We then strap the trees to the rooftops of our cars or inside our truck beds.  We string tie them to the roofs, in order to transport and parade them throughout downtown San Antonio, to showcase how many would have done so, back in the olden days. It also gives us a chance to cruise downtown San Antonio and showcase our rides along with observing the holiday lights that light up the San Antonio downtown area, specifically the Riverwalk tree-line.
The best part of the Christmas Tree run is delivering these trees to designated low income or underprivileged families who have been nominated by close friend's and family of the club.  For the most part we ask that it usually be someone who we don't particularly know so it has more of an impact on the family.  The tree is delivered along with Christmas lights, ornaments, extension cords, and a tree stand, all provided by one member and their family.
