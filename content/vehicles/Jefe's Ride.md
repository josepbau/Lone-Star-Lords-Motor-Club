Our Club President's 1954 Oldsmobile is sure to turn heads wherever we go.  With the static drop, Metallic Green paint job, shiney chrome hubcaps, and the wide whites it always catches the crowd's attention. With one of his numerous 1954 rides, this one leads the Club where ever we roll! [Club President- Scott (Jefe)](../members/Club%20President-%20Scott%20(Jefe).md)
