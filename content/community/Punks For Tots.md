**Christmas is a season of giving and thats what we do by teaming up with this local benefit called Punks For Tots! Phillip "Filthy" Gomez is the host of this fantastic event that we are proud to attend every year.**

**For over 20 years now Filthy has hosted the event Punks for Tots to promote local San Antonio Punk bands and raise funds and donations for low-income and underprivileged kids in the local area.  All proceeds and donations go to local foundations who serve the community.** 

**Our club has been assigned a family in the past, where we have provided toys and gifts so they may experience an enjoyable Christmas and have some gifts to give to their children this holiday season.**
